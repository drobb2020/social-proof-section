## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Setting up a structured SCSS system (i.e. not everything in one file).
- Complex styling and layout challenges using both Flexbox and Grid.

### Continued development

I still need to work on my basic CSS skills. HTML markup is straight forward, but styling is still a bit of a challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - Kevin is a great help in understanding CSS and SCSS. I highly recommend following Kevin.
